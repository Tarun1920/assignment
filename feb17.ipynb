    "\n",
    "Non-relational databases, often referred to as NoSQL databases, are a category of databases that do not use the traditional tabular relational model for data storage.\n",
    "They offer more flexibility in terms of data structures, making it easier to handle unstructured or semi-structured data.\n",
    "NoSQL databases are typically designed to scale out horizontally, which means they can easily handle large amounts of data and high traffic loads.\n",
    "\n",
    "When to use MongoDB over SQL databases:\n",
    "\n",
    "Flexible Data Models: MongoDB is schema-less, allowing you to store data in a flexible, JSON-like format. This makes it a good choice for applications with evolving or rapidly changing data requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scalability: MongoDB is designed to scale horizontally, which makes it well-suited for applications that need to handle large amounts of data and traffic. It can distribute data across multiple servers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Real-time Analytics: If you require real-time analytics or need to process large volumes of data quickly, MongoDB's document-based structure and ability to shard data can be advantageous.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use Case: MongoDB is commonly used in scenarios such as content management systems, catalog management, user profiles, and IoT applications where data may not fit neatly into traditional relational tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Geospatial Data: MongoDB has built-in support for geospatial indexing and queries, making it a strong choice for location-based applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "Agile Development: MongoDB aligns well with agile development practices, as you can adapt your data model easily as project requirements change"

    "MongoDB is a popular NoSQL database management system known for its flexibility, scalability, and ease of use. \n",

    "Document-Oriented: MongoDB is a document database, which means it stores data in flexible, JSON-like BSON (Binary JSON) documents. Each document can have a different structure, making it suitable for semi-structured or unstructured data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Schema-less: MongoDB is schema-less, allowing you to add fields to documents on the fly. This flexibility is useful when dealing with rapidly evolving data models.\n",
    "\n",
    "High Performance: MongoDB is designed for high performance. It uses an internal memory-mapped storage engine and supports various indexing techniques to optimize query performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Horizontal Scalability: MongoDB supports horizontal scaling through sharding. This means you can distribute data across multiple servers to handle large datasets and high traffic loads.\n",
    "\n",
    "Replication: MongoDB offers data replication for high availability. It creates multiple copies of data, ensuring that if one server fails, another can take over without data loss. This is essential for fault tolerance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Flexible Query Language: MongoDB provides a powerful and flexible query language with support for rich queries, geospatial queries, and text searches. It also supports aggregation pipelines for complex data processing.\n"
