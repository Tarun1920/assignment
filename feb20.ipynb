    "Data Transmission: Data is appended to the URL in the form of parameters. This makes it visible in the browser's address bar.\n",
    "Security: Since data is part of the URL, it is less secure compared to POST, and sensitive information should not be sent via GET.\n",

    "In Flask, the redirect() function is used to perform HTTP redirection, which means it instructs the client's web browser to navigate to a different URL.

    "Handling URL Changes: It helps manage changes in URL paths, ensuring that users are directed to the appropriate route or endpoint based on certain conditions or actions. For instance, you might want to redirect users to an error page if they attempt to access a resource they're not authorized to view.\n",

    "Implementing RESTful Behavior: In RESTful web applications, you can use redirect() to provide responses with the appropriate HTTP status codes (e.g., 301 or 302 for redirections) to indicate the status of a resource's location.\n",

    "Templates in Flask are a fundamental part of building dynamic web applications. They allow you to separate the presentation logic (HTML) from your application logic (Python code) by creating HTML templates with placeholders that can be filled with dynamic content. Flask uses a templating engine, typically Jinja2, to render these templates. Templates help in producing consistent, maintainable, and scalable web applications"
