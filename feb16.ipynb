    "A database is a structured collection of data that is organized in a way\n",

    "data. Databases are used in various applications and systems to manage\n",
    "and store data in a systematic and organized manner.\n",

    "SQL Databases:\n",
    "Structured Query Language (SQL): SQL databases are relational databases that use a structured query language (SQL) for defining and manipulating the data. SQL is a standard programming language for managing and manipulating relational databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "Schema: SQL databases have a predefined schema, which means the structure of the data (tables, columns, and relationships) must be defined before data is added to the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "ACID Properties: SQL databases follow the ACID properties (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability), which ensure that database transactions are processed reliably.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scalability: SQL databases are generally vertically scalable, meaning you can increase the capacity of a single server by increasing things like CPU, RAM, or SSD.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples: MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "NoSQL Databases:\n",
    "Not Only SQL (NoSQL): NoSQL databases are non-relational databases that do not require a fixed schema and are often more flexible. They can store and process unstructured data, and they don't use SQL as their primary query language.\n",
    "\n",
    "Schema-less: NoSQL databases are schema-less or have a dynamic schema, allowing you to insert data without first defining its structure. This flexibility is beneficial for handling semi-structured or unstructured data.\n",
    "\n",
    "CAP Theorem: NoSQL databases are designed based on the CAP theorem (Consistency, Availability, Partition Tolerance), where systems can achieve at most two out of these three guarantees simultaneously.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scalability: NoSQL databases are typically horizontally scalable, meaning you can add more servers to your NoSQL database to handle larger loads.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples: MongoDB, CouchDB, Cassandra, Redis, Amazon DynamoDB.\n",

    "A foreign key is a field in a database table that is used to establish a link or relationship between two tables. It defines a relationship between data in two different tables, typically by referencing the primary key of another table.\n",
