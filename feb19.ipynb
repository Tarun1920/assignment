    "Flask is a micro web framework written in Python. It is classified as a microframework because it does not require particular tools or libraries. It has no database abstraction layer, form validation, or any other components where pre-existing third-party libraries provide common functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lightweight and Easy to Use:\n",
    "Flask is designed to be simple and easy to use. Its syntax is straightforward and doesn't require much boilerplate code, making it a great choice for beginners and for projects where simplicity is a priority.\n",
    "\n",
    "Modularity:\n",
    "Flask is built with modularity in mind. It doesn't impose any specific project structure, allowing developers to choose the components and libraries they need for a particular project. This modularity also makes it easy to integrate Flask with other tools and libraries.\n",
    "\n",
    "Flexibility:\n",
    "Flask is unopinionated, meaning it doesn't force developers to use a specific set of tools or patterns. This flexibility allows developers to choose the components they prefer for tasks such as database integration, template engines, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "Werkzeug and Jinja2:\n",
    "Flask is built on top of the Werkzeug WSGI toolkit and the Jinja2 template engine. Werkzeug provides a set of utilities for building web applications, and Jinja2 is a powerful template engine that allows for dynamic content generation. These components enhance Flask's capabilities and contribute to its effectiveness.\n",
    "\n",
    "Extensibility:\n",
    "Flask can be easily extended with various extensions to add functionality as needed. There are numerous extensions available for tasks like authentication, database integration, form handling, and more. This extensibility allows developers to tailor Flask to their specific requirements.\n",

    "In Flask, routing refers to the process of mapping URLs (Uniform Resource Locators) to view functions in your application. App routing is a fundamental concept in Flask that allows you to define how different URLs are handled by your web application. It determines which Python function (view function) should be executed when a particular URL is requested.\n",
    "\n",
    " Here's why app routes are used:\n",
    "\n",
    "URL Handling: App routes allow you to specify which function should be executed when a specific URL is accessed. For example, you can define that when a user goes to \"http://yourwebsite.com/home,\" a particular Python function should handle that request.\n",
    "\n",
    "URL Structure: They help you define the structure of your web application's URLs. You can create meaningful and human-readable URLs that correspond to specific content or actions within your application.\n",
    "\n",
    "RESTful APIs: In the context of building RESTful APIs, app routes are crucial for mapping HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.) to specific functions, enabling you to create a well-structured and consistent API.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dynamic URLs: App routes can include dynamic components in URLs, such as variables that change from request to request. This is useful for creating routes that respond to user input or resource identifiers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Separation of Concerns: Routing helps separate the logic for handling different parts of your application. This follows the principles of good software design and makes your code more organized and maintainable.\n",
